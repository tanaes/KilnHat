# KilnHat
PCB for running a kiln from a Raspberry Pi.

Has three MOSFET channels for controlling a mechanical safety relay, an SSR, and a fan. On-board thermocouple amplifier. Includes outputs for digital displays, addressable LEDs, and an I2C port.


*This is not yet a true 'hat' as I haven't yet implemented the full requirements!* However, my goal is to test the initial prototypes and add the required I2C EEPROM and over-voltage protection circuitry in a subsequent revision.
